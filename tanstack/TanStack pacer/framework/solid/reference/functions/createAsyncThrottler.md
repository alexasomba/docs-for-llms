# Function: createAsyncThrottler()

```ts
function createAsyncThrottler<TFn, TSelected>(
   fn, 
   options, 
selector): SolidAsyncThrottler<TFn, TSelected>;
```

Defined in: [solid-pacer/src/async-throttler/createAsyncThrottler.ts:145](https://github.com/TanStack/pacer/blob/main/packages/solid-pacer/src/async-throttler/createAsyncThrottler.ts#L145)

A low-level Solid hook that creates an `AsyncThrottler` instance to limit how often an async function can execute.

This hook is designed to be flexible and state-management agnostic - it simply returns a throttler instance that
you can integrate with any state management solution (createSignal, etc).

Async throttling ensures an async function executes at most once within a specified time window,
regardless of how many times it is called. This is useful for rate-limiting expensive API calls,
database operations, or other async tasks.

Unlike the non-async Throttler, this async version supports returning values from the throttled function,
making it ideal for API calls and other async operations where you want the result of the `maybeExecute` call
instead of setting the result on a state variable from within the throttled function.

Error Handling:
- If an `onError` handler is provided, it will be called with the error and throttler instance
- If `throwOnError` is true (default when no onError handler is provided), the error will be thrown
- If `throwOnError` is false (default when onError handler is provided), the error will be swallowed
- Both onError and throwOnError can be used together - the handler will be called before any error is thrown
- The error state can be checked using the underlying AsyncThrottler instance

## State Management and Selector

The hook uses TanStack Store for reactive state management. You can subscribe to state changes
in two ways:

**1. Using `throttler.Subscribe` component (Recommended for component tree subscriptions)**

Use the `Subscribe` component to subscribe to state changes deep in your component tree without
needing to pass a selector to the hook. This is ideal when you want to subscribe to state
in child components.

**2. Using the `selector` parameter (For hook-level subscriptions)**

The `selector` parameter allows you to specify which state changes will trigger reactive updates
at the hook level, optimizing performance by preventing unnecessary updates when irrelevant
state changes occur.

**By default, there will be no reactive state subscriptions** and you must opt-in to state
tracking by providing a selector function or using the `Subscribe` component. This prevents unnecessary
updates and gives you full control over when your component tracks state changes.

Available state properties:
- `canLeadingExecute`: Whether the throttler can execute on the leading edge
- `canTrailingExecute`: Whether the throttler can execute on the trailing edge
- `executionCount`: Number of function executions that have been completed
- `hasError`: Whether the last execution resulted in an error
- `isPending`: Whether the throttler is waiting for the timeout to trigger execution
- `isExecuting`: Whether an async function execution is currently in progress
- `lastArgs`: The arguments from the most recent call to maybeExecute
- `lastError`: The error from the most recent failed execution (if any)
- `lastExecutionTime`: Timestamp of the last execution
- `lastResult`: The result from the most recent successful execution
- `nextExecutionTime`: Timestamp of the next allowed execution
- `status`: Current execution status ('disabled' | 'idle' | 'pending' | 'executing')

## Type Parameters

### TFn

`TFn` *extends* `AnyAsyncFunction`

### TSelected

`TSelected` = \{
\}

## Parameters

### fn

`TFn`

### options

`AsyncThrottlerOptions`\<`TFn`\>

### selector

(`state`) => `TSelected`

## Returns

[`SolidAsyncThrottler`](../interfaces/SolidAsyncThrottler.md)\<`TFn`, `TSelected`\>

## Example

```tsx
// Default behavior - no reactive state subscriptions
const { maybeExecute } = createAsyncThrottler(
  async (id: string) => {
    const data = await api.fetchData(id);
    return data;
  },
  { wait: 1000 }
);

// Opt-in to track isPending or isExecuting changes (optimized for loading states)
const throttler = createAsyncThrottler(
  async (query) => {
    const result = await searchAPI(query);
    return result;
  },
  { wait: 2000 },
  (state) => ({ isPending: state.isPending, isExecuting: state.isExecuting })
);

// Opt-in to track error state changes (optimized for error handling)
const throttler = createAsyncThrottler(
  async (query) => {
    const result = await searchAPI(query);
    return result;
  },
  {
    wait: 2000,
    leading: true,   // Execute immediately on first call
    trailing: false, // Skip trailing edge updates
    onError: (error) => {
      console.error('API call failed:', error);
    }
  },
  (state) => ({ hasError: state.hasError, lastError: state.lastError })
);

// Access the selected state (will be empty object {} unless selector provided)
const { isPending, isExecuting } = throttler.state();
```
