Cloudflare R2 Storage allows developers to store large amounts of unstructured data without the costly egress bandwidth fees associated with typical cloud storage services.

## Before you begin

You need a Cloudflare account with an R2 subscription. If you do not have one:
1. Go to the [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/).
2. Select **Storage & databases > R2 > Overview**
3. Complete the checkout flow to add an R2 subscription to your account.

R2 is free to get started with included free monthly usage. You are billed for your usage on a monthly basis. Refer to [Pricing](/r2/pricing/) for details.

## Choose how to access R2

R2 supports multiple access methods, so you can choose the one that fits your use case best:

| Method                                                             | Use when                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Workers API](/r2/get-started/workers-api/)                        | You are building an application on Cloudflare Workers that needs to read or write from R2 |
| [S3](/r2/get-started/s3/)                                          | You want to use S3-compatible SDKs to interact with R2 in your existing applications      |
| [CLI tools](/r2/get-started/cli/)                                  | You want to upload, download, or manage objects from your terminal                        |
| [Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/r2/overview) | You want to quickly view and manage buckets and objects in the browser                    |
