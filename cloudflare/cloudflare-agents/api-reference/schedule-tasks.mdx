An Agent can schedule tasks to be run in the future by calling `this.schedule(when, callback, data)`, where `when` can be a delay, a `Date`, or a cron string; `callback` the function name to call, and `data` is an object of data to pass to the function.

Scheduled tasks can do anything a request or message from a user can: make requests, query databases, send emails, read+write state: scheduled tasks can invoke any regular method on your Agent.

:::note[Calling destroy() in scheduled tasks]

You can safely call `this.destroy()` within a scheduled task callback. The Agent will properly handle cleanup and eviction, skipping any remaining database updates after the destroy flag is set.

:::

### Scheduling tasks

You can call `this.schedule` within any method on an Agent, and schedule tens-of-thousands of tasks per individual Agent:

<TypeScriptExample>

```ts
import { Agent } from "agents"

export class SchedulingAgent extends Agent {
	async onRequest(request) {
		// Handle an incoming request
		// Schedule a task 10 minutes from now
		// Calls the "checkFlights" method
		let { taskId } = await this.schedule(600, "checkFlights", { flight: "DL264", date: "2025-02-23" });
		return Response.json({ taskId });
	}

	async checkFlights(data) {
		// Invoked when our scheduled task runs
		// We can also call this.schedule here to schedule another task
	}
}
```
</TypeScriptExample>

:::caution

Tasks that set a callback for a method that does not exist will throw an exception: ensure that the method named in the `callback` argument of `this.schedule` exists on your `Agent` class.

:::

You can schedule tasks in multiple ways:

<TypeScriptExample>

```ts
// schedule a task to run immediately
let task = await this.schedule(0, "someTask", { message: "hello" });

// schedule a task to run in 10 seconds
let task = await this.schedule(10, "someTask", { message: "hello" });

// schedule a task to run at a specific date
let task = await this.schedule(new Date("2025-01-01"), "someTask", {});

// schedule a task to run every 10 minutes
let { id } = await this.schedule("*/10 * * * *", "someTask", { message: "hello" });

// schedule a task to run every 10 minutes, but only on Mondays
let task = await this.schedule("*/10 * * * 1", "someTask", { message: "hello" });

// cancel a scheduled task
this.cancelSchedule(task.id);
```

</TypeScriptExample>

Calling `await this.schedule` returns a `Schedule`, which includes the task's randomly generated `id`. You can use this `id` to retrieve or cancel the task in the future. It also provides a `type` property that indicates the type of schedule, for example, one of `"scheduled" | "delayed" | "cron"`.

:::note[Maximum scheduled tasks]

Each task is mapped to a row in the Agent's underlying [SQLite database](/durable-objects/api/sqlite-storage-api/), which means that each task can be up to 2 MB in size. The maximum number of tasks must be `(task_size * tasks) + all_other_state < maximum_database_size` (currently 1GB per Agent).

:::

:::note[Destroying an Agent from a scheduled task]

You can safely call `this.destroy()` from within a scheduled task callback. The Agent SDK handles this scenario by setting an internal flag to prevent database updates after destruction and deferring the context abort to allow the alarm handler to complete cleanly. This prevents errors that would otherwise occur when the alarm handler attempts to update the schedule table after storage has been cleared.

:::

### Managing scheduled tasks

You can get, cancel and filter across scheduled tasks within an Agent using the scheduling API:

<TypeScriptExample>

```ts
// Get a specific schedule by ID
// Returns undefined if the task does not exist
let task = await this.getSchedule(task.id)

// Get all scheduled tasks
// Returns an array of Schedule objects
let tasks = this.getSchedules();

// Cancel a task by its ID
// Returns true if the task was cancelled, false if it did not exist
await this.cancelSchedule(task.id);

// Filter for specific tasks
// e.g. all tasks starting in the next hour
let tasks = this.getSchedules({
	timeRange: {
		start: new Date(Date.now()),
		end: new Date(Date.now() + 60 * 60 * 1000),
	}
});
```

</TypeScriptExample>

### Lifecycle management with scheduled tasks

When working with scheduled tasks, you can safely call `this.destroy()` from within a scheduled callback to terminate the Agent instance after completing a task. The Agent SDK properly handles the cleanup process to ensure scheduled tasks complete successfully before the Agent is evicted.

<TypeScriptExample>

```ts
export class SchedulingAgent extends Agent {
	async onRequest(request) {
		// Schedule a self-destructing task
		await this.schedule(60, "cleanupAndDestroy");
		return new Response("Agent will self-destruct in 60 seconds");
	}

	async cleanupAndDestroy(data) {
		// Perform final cleanup operations
		await this.sendEmail({
			to: "admin@example.com",
			subject: "Task completed",
			body: "Agent task finished, shutting down"
		});

		// Safely destroy the Agent instance
		// The destroy operation will complete after this callback finishes
		await this.destroy();
	}
}
```

</TypeScriptExample>

:::note

When `destroy()` is called from within a scheduled task, the Agent SDK defers the destruction to ensure the scheduled callback completes successfully. The Agent instance will be evicted immediately after the callback finishes executing.
