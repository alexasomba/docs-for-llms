Workflow entrypoints can be declared using Python. To achieve this, you can export a `WorkflowEntrypoint` that runs on the Cloudflare Workers platform.
Refer to [Python Workers](/workers/languages/python) for more information about Python on the Workers runtime.

:::caution[Python Workflows are in beta, as well as the underlying platform.]

## Get Started

The main entrypoint for a Python workflow is the [`WorkflowEntrypoint`](/workflows/build/workers-api/#workflowentrypoint) class. Your workflow logic should exist inside the [`run`](/workflows/build/workers-api/#run) handler.

```python
from workers import WorkflowEntrypoint

class MyWorkflow(WorkflowEntrypoint):
    async def run(self, event, step):
        # steps here
```

For example, a Workflow may be defined as:

```python
from workers import Response, WorkflowEntrypoint

class PythonWorkflowStarter(WorkflowEntrypoint):
    async def run(self, event, step):

        @step.do('step1')
        async def step_1():
            # does stuff
            print('executing step1')

        @step.do('step2')
        async def step_2():
            # does stuff
            print('executing step2')

        await await_step(step_1,step_2)

async def on_fetch(request, env):
    await env.MY_WORKFLOW.create()
    return Response("Hello world!")
```

You must add both `python_workflows` and `python_workers` compatibility flags to your Wrangler configuration file.

<WranglerConfig>
```jsonc
{
	"$schema": "./node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json",
	"name": "hello-python",
	"main": "src/entry.py",
	"compatibility_flags": [
		"python_workers",
		"experimental",
		"python_workflows"
	],
	"compatibility_date": "2024-03-29",
	"workflows": [
		{
			"name": "workflows-demo",
			"binding": "MY_WORKFLOW",
			"class_name": "PythonWorkflowStarter"
		}
	]
}
```
</WranglerConfig>

To run a Python Workflow locally, use [Wrangler](/workers/wrangler/), the CLI for Cloudflare Workers:

```bash
npx wrangler@latest dev
```

To deploy a Python Workflow to Cloudflare, run [`wrangler deploy`](/workers/wrangler/commands/#deploy):

```bash
npx wrangler@latest deploy
```
