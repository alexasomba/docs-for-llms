## Send build notifications

You can deploy a Worker that consumes build events and sends notifications to Slack, Discord, or any webhook endpoint:

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/cloudflare/templates/tree/main/workers-builds-notifications-template)

The template sends notifications for:

- Successful builds with preview or live deployment URLs
- Failed builds with error messages
- Cancelled builds

![Example Slack notifications for Workers Builds events](~/assets/images/changelog/workers/builds-notifications-slack.png)

You can customize the Worker to format messages for your webhook provider. For setup instructions, refer to the [template README](https://github.com/cloudflare/templates/tree/main/workers-builds-notifications-template#readme).
