import { TypeScriptExample, WranglerConfig } from "~/components";

[Workers Analytics Engine](/analytics/analytics-engine/) provides time-series analytics at scale. Use it to track custom metrics, build usage-based billing, or understand service health on a per-customer basis.

Unlike logs, Analytics Engine is designed for aggregated queries over high-cardinality data. Writes are non-blocking and do not impact request latency.

## Configure the binding

Add an Analytics Engine dataset binding to your Wrangler configuration file. The dataset is created automatically when you first write to it.

<WranglerConfig>

```jsonc
{
	"analytics_engine_datasets": [
		{
			"binding": "ANALYTICS",
			"dataset": "my_dataset",
		},
	],
}
```

</WranglerConfig>

## Write data points

<TypeScriptExample>

```ts
interface Env {
	ANALYTICS: AnalyticsEngineDataset;
}

export default {
	async fetch(request: Request, env: Env): Promise<Response> {
		const url = new URL(request.url);

		// Write a page view event
		env.ANALYTICS.writeDataPoint({
			blobs: [
				url.pathname,
				request.headers.get("cf-connecting-country") ?? "unknown",
			],
			doubles: [1], // Count
			indexes: [url.hostname], // Sampling key
		});

		// Write a response timing event
		const start = Date.now();
		const response = await fetch(request);
		const duration = Date.now() - start;

		env.ANALYTICS.writeDataPoint({
			blobs: [url.pathname, response.status.toString()],
			doubles: [duration],
			indexes: [url.hostname],
		});

		// Writes are non-blocking - no need to await or use waitUntil()
		return response;
	},
};
```

</TypeScriptExample>

## Data point structure

Each data point consists of:

- **blobs** (strings) - Dimensions for grouping and filtering. Use for paths, regions, status codes, or customer IDs.
- **doubles** (numbers) - Numeric values to record, such as counts, durations, or sizes.
- **indexes** (strings) - A single string used as the [sampling key](/analytics/analytics-engine/sql-api/#sampling). Group related events under the same index.

## Query your data

Query your data using the [SQL API](/analytics/analytics-engine/sql-api/):

```bash
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID/analytics_engine/sql" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \
  --data "SELECT blob1 AS path, SUM(_sample_interval) AS views FROM my_dataset WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '1' HOUR GROUP BY path ORDER BY views DESC LIMIT 10"
```
