In this guide, you will learn how to create and use your first AI Gateway.

### Authenticated gateway 🔒 

When you enable authentication on a gateway, each request is required to include a valid Cloudflare API token, adding an extra layer of security. We recommend using an authenticated gateway to prevent unauthorized access. [Learn more](/ai-gateway/configuration/authentication/).

## Provider Authentication

Authenticate with your upstream AI provider using one of the following options:

- **Unified Billing:** Use the AI Gateway billing to pay for and authenticate your inference requests. Refer to [Unified Billing](/ai-gateway/features/unified-billing/).
- **BYOK (Store Keys):** Store your own provider API Keys with Cloudflare, and AI Gateway will include them at runtime. Refer to [BYOK](/ai-gateway/configuration/bring-your-own-keys/).
- **Request headers:** Include your provider API Key in the request headers as you normally would (for example, `Authorization: Bearer <OPENAI_API_KEY>`).

## Integration Options

### Unified API Endpoint

<br />
<br />

The easiest way to get started with AI Gateway is through our OpenAI-compatible `/chat/completions` endpoint. This allows you to use existing OpenAI SDKs and tools with minimal code changes while gaining access to multiple AI providers.

`
https://gateway.ai.cloudflare.com/v1/{account_id}/{gateway_name}/compat/chat/completions
`

**Key benefits:**

- Drop-in replacement for OpenAI API, works with existing OpenAI SDKs and other OpenAI compliant clients
- Switch between providers by changing the `model` parameter
- Dynamic Routing - Define complex routing scenarios requiring conditional logic, conduct A/B tests, set rate / budget limits, etc


#### Example:

<CodeSnippets forceAPI="unified" />


Refer to [Unified API](/ai-gateway/usage/chat-completion/) to learn more about OpenAI compatibility.

### Provider-specific endpoints

For direct integration with specific AI providers, use dedicated endpoints that maintain the original provider's API schema while adding AI Gateway features.

```

**Available providers:**

- [OpenAI](/ai-gateway/usage/providers/openai/) - GPT models and embeddings
- [Anthropic](/ai-gateway/usage/providers/anthropic/) - Claude models
- [Google AI Studio](/ai-gateway/usage/providers/google-ai-studio/) - Gemini models
- [Workers AI](/ai-gateway/usage/providers/workersai/) - Cloudflare's inference platform
- [AWS Bedrock](/ai-gateway/usage/providers/bedrock/) - Amazon's managed AI service
- [Azure OpenAI](/ai-gateway/usage/providers/azureopenai/) - Microsoft's OpenAI service
- [and more...](/ai-gateway/usage/providers/)
