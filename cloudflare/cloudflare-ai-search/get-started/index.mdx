AI Search is Cloudflare's managed search service. Connect your data such as websites or an R2 bucket, and it automatically creates a continuously updating index that you can query with natural language in your applications or AI agents.

## Prerequisites

AI Search integrates with R2 for storing your data. You must have an active R2 subscription before creating your first AI Search instance.

<DashButton url="/?to=/:account/r2/overview" buttonName="R2 Overview" />
